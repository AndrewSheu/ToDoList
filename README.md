#ToDo List - Users are able to add ToDo thing in the List, and also able to delete.

In this project, I created 4 DOM, 3 Eventlistener, 3 Function.

When user type todo information and click the add or press Enter.
The program will first recieved the sendData or typing event and then execute the function addData.
When user type click the delete.
The program will first recieved the list event and then execute the function deleteData.
UpdataList is to make sure the program datas are always right.

Use localstorage to store the add todo, converted to string.

New CSS used: hover, focus, min-height

New Javascript used: querySelector, JSON.parse, JSON.stringify, localstorage, addEventListener, trim, preventDefault, innerHTML, target.nodeName
